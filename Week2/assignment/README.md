# Week 2 Assignment

**Submission deadline: September 5th, 2015, 6:00 PM**


## Problem 1. Survey.

Complete this [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gH-6Fz4-oynqSJkgkUX3rhAnri4aCRdiMTcHCiP6S3g/viewform).

## Problem 2. Values and Types.

Use the IPython/Jupyter notebook template: [`types.ipynb`](types.ipynb).

You can download the template by updating your local course repository that you created in [Week 1 Lesson 2](https://github.com/UI-DataScience/info490-fa15/blob/master/Week1/lesson2.md), e.g. `/home/data_scientist/info490`. Open a terminal, either by using _New_ -> _Terminal_ in the IPython/Jupyter notebooks server, or by using the interactive terminal mode in Docker:

```shell
$ docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash
```

You can find the container name by doing `docker ps`. At the Unix shell, go to the directory where the course repository is mounted,

```shell
$ cd /home/data_scientist/info490
```

and use `git pull` to update the local repository:

```shell
$ git pull
```

Now, if you navigate to `/home/data_scientist/info490/Week2/assignment`, you will discover that the `git pull` command has updated the contents of the local repository.

Alternatively, you can directly download the [template file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UI-DataScience/info490-fa15/master/Week2/assignment/types.ipynb) and import it into your notebook server.

Submit your completed assignment onto Moodle for peer assessment.
